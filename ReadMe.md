# GitHub Actions Tutorial

**Disclaimer:** While I worked with multiple CI systems (Circle CI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis) in the past, I was never more than a user of these systems. Therefore I would recommend to **take all information below with a grain** (or multiple kilos üòÖ) **of salt**.

## Usual Tasks of CI(/CD) Systems

- **Code analysis** (e.g type checking, style checks)
- **Test** execution
- **Software packaging** (compilation)
- Building **documentation** (e.g. HTML/PDF documentation)
- **Deployment**:
  - Store packages/documentation at correct location
  - Start/stop (web) services

## Hello World

GitHub Actions, like most other CI systems (I know of), reads actions it should execute from [YAML](https://yaml.org) files. These (workflow) files should be stored in the directory `.github/workflows` in the root of the repository.

In our first example we will create a rather minimal version of such a workflow file:

```yaml
on:
  - push

jobs:
  linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - run: printf 'Hello, World\n'
```

To execute the workflow above we need to follow the steps below:

1. Create a Git repository
2. Store the YAML content above in the file `hello.yaml` in the directory `.github/workflows`
3. Create a commit containing `hello.yaml`
4. Publish the repository at [GitHub](https://github.com)

After you followed the steps above you should be able to see the execution of the CI run in the repository web page under the tab **‚ÄúActions‚Äù**:

<img src="Pictures/Hello World Run.webp" alt="Hello World Run" width="600"/>

After you click on the commit message ‚Äì ‚ÄúCI: Add ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù workflow‚Äù in the example above ‚Äì GitHub should show you are more detailed description about the workflow run:

<img src="Pictures/Hello World Details.webp" alt="Hello World Details" width="600"/>

The picture above shows us that out workflow contains exactly one job called `linux`. We now click on the job to see a detailed view of the job output:

<img src="Pictures/Hello World Output.webp" alt="Hello World Output" width="600"/>

The ‚ÄúSet up job‚Äù section tells us some information about the runner (computer that executed the job). For example, we can see that the operating system of the runner is Ubuntu `22.04.2`, because we used the value `ubuntu-latest` for the key `runs-on`.

The section ‚ÄúRun printf 'Hello, World\n'‚Äù shows us the output of our only workflow step. Just like we expected the shell command we used (`printf ‚Ä¶`) prints the text ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù.

### Describing a Workflow

While navigating the workflow and the output for our small example was reasonable, it makes sense to describe

- the workflow,
- the jobs (that are part of a workflow) and
- the steps (that are part of a job)

further. To do that we can use the key `name`. Let us add some basic description to our ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù workflow:

```yaml
name: Hello World

on:
  - push

jobs:
  linux:
    name: üêß Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Print ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù
        run: printf 'Hello, World\n'
```

After we commit and push our changes the list of workflows:

<img src="Pictures/Hello World Workflows.webp" alt="Hello World Workflows" width="300"/>

the job name:

<img src="Pictures/Hello World Job.webp" alt="Hello World Job" width="250"/>

and our job step:

<img src="Pictures/Hello World Step.webp" alt="Hello World Step" width="350"/>

displays the name we provided.

## Command Return Values & Failing Jobs

In our ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù example, everything worked as expected and hence the CI run finished with the status ‚Äúpassed‚Äù displaying a green checkmark. How does a certain (test) command then tell that something went wrong. The usual way is the return value of the command, also often called **exit or status** value. The status value is a number that will/should be

- **`0`** if everything **worked as expected** or
- **any other number than `0`** (often `1`) if the command did **not finish successfully**.

Usually you can also **tell certain errors apart from their return value**. For example most shells return `127` if a command was not found.

There are even two simple commands `false` and `true` that do nothing except for setting the status value to:

- `0`: `true` and
- `1`: `false`.

These values might be **inverted to what you expect from other programming languages** like C, where `0` represents false and all other numbers represent true.

If you want to set the exit value in a program yourself you can usually use a function called `exit` or something similar. For example, you can use the following line of Python code to write your own version of the command `false`:

```py
exit(1)
```

Now lets add a new workflow called ‚ÄúReturn Values‚Äù that we store in a file called `return.yaml` in the directory `.github/workflows`:

```yaml
name: Return Values

on:
  - push

jobs:
  linux:
    name: üêß Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Execute command that sets return value to 1
        # Quotes are required, since the text `false` represent the
        # **boolean value ‚Äúfalse‚Äù**. The text `"false"` (with quotes)
        # on the other hand represent the **string `false`**.
        run: "false"
```

After we push our changes we see that there are now two workflows listed under the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù tab of the repository page:

<img src="Pictures/Multiple Workflows.webp" alt="Multiple Workflows" width="300"/>

> **Note:** Workflows are independent of each other, which makes them ideal for doing tasks that are quite different. For example you can use a workflow that builds and deploys documentation, while another workflow tests the software.

While the workflow ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù finished successfully, just like before, the workflow ‚ÄúReturn Values‚Äù failed as we expected:

<img src="Pictures/Overall Status.webp" alt="Overall Status" width="300"/>

We take a closer look and see that the step ‚ÄúExecute command that sets return value to 1‚Äù did indeed set the exit value to 1:

<img src="Pictures/Return Value False.webp" alt="Return Value False" width="450"/>

## Multiple Steps

Since we now know how we can write a basic workflow containing a single step it is time to look at how we can execute jobs after each other. For that purpose we remove `hello.yaml` and `return.yaml` and add a new workflow called `multiple steps.yaml` in the directory `.github/workflows`:

```yaml
name: Sequential Execution

on:
  - push

jobs:
  linux:
    name: üêß Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Works
        run: "true"

      - name: Fails
        run: "false"

      - name: Works too
        run: "true"
```

As you can see this workflow contains three jobs called

- ‚ÄúWorks‚Äù,
- ‚ÄúFails‚Äù and
- ‚ÄúWorks too‚Äù.

These steps will be executed one after each other. The whole job will fail after the first step that fails. Steps after the first failed step will not be executed. We can see that, if we take a look at the output of our job:
